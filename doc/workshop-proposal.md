# Title: "Integrating GTFS Transit Data with Spatial Analysis in R: A Hands-On Workshop"

## Abstract
The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS, https://gtfs.org/) is a widely-used standard for sharing public transit data, and R is a powerful programming language for spatial analysis and visualization. In this workshop, participants will learn how to combine GTFS transit data with spatial analysis techniques in R, enabling them to conduct more comprehensive analyses of transit systems.

## Objectives:

- Understand the basics of GTFS transit data and how it can be integrated with spatial data
- Import GTFS data into R and link it with spatial data
- Conduct spatial analyses on transit data in R
- Visualize transit data using spatial maps and charts

## Description
The workshop "Integrating GTFS Transit Data with Spatial Analysis in R: A Hands-On Workshop" is designed for participants with a basic working knowledge of R who are interested in learning how to analyze public transit systems using GTFS and R. The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a widely used format for exchanging public transit data, while R is a powerful programming language for data analysis and visualization.

During the workshop, participants will learn the basics of GTFS transit data and how it can be integrated with spatial data. This will include an overview of GTFS data structure and how to import GTFS data into R. Participants will then learn how to link GTFS data with spatial data, allowing them to conduct more comprehensive analyses of transit systems.

After linking the data, participants will conduct spatial analyses on transit data using R. This will include mapping transit routes, identifying spatial patterns of transit accessibility. In addition to conducting the analyses, participants will also learn how to visualize transit data using spatial maps and charts, allowing them to communicate their findings more effectively.

The workshop will be a hands-on session, where participants will work through examples of integrating GTFS transit data with spatial analysis in R. Participants will need to bring their own laptops with R and RStudio installed. The workshop will include a mix of lecture, demonstration, and interactive exercises.

The overall objective of this workshop is to provide participants with practical skills in integrating GTFS transit data with spatial analysis techniques in R. Participants will leave with the ability to apply these skills to their own GIS projects involving transit data, allowing them to gain valuable insights into public transit systems and contribute to data-driven decision making.

## Target audience
This workshop is intended for participants with some experience in GIS and an interest in transit data analysis. Participants should have a basic working knowledge of R. Prior knowledge of GTFS is not required.

## Format:
The workshop will be a hands-on session where participants will work through examples of integrating GTFS transit data with spatial analysis in R.
